# MNIST Digital Data Recognition with MLP

This repository demonstrates how to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It also includes tools for testing trained models and a simple GUI application for digit recognition.

## Folder Structure

### `mnist11`
This folder contains scripts to **train MLP models** on the MNIST dataset.  
- You can customize the network architecture and training parameters here.

### `TestTrainedModel_mnist`
This folder contains scripts to **evaluate trained models**.  
- Generates **confusion matrices** and calculates **accuracy** on test data.

### `digitalRecognize`
A simple **GUI application** that allows users to **draw digits with the mouse** and recognize them using a trained model.  
- Useful for testing model predictions in real-time.
